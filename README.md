# Spatial Databases - Practical Work Overview  
 
---

## **Introduction**  
This practical work focuses on **Spatial SQL**, a specialized extension of SQL used for managing and querying spatial data. By leveraging tools like **PostGIS** (a spatial extension of PostgreSQL) and **QGIS**, this TP explores how spatial data can be stored, manipulated, and analyzed. Spatial SQL enables users to perform operations such as distance calculations, proximity analysis, and spatial joins, which are crucial in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and various real-world applications, including urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring.

## **TD-1: Installation of PostGIS and Creation of a Spatial Database**  
- Installation of PostgreSQL and the PostGIS extension.  
- Creation of a spatial database using pgAdmin.  
- Verification of the PostGIS setup.  

---

## **TD-2: Creating Tables with Spatial Columns**  
- Creation of spatial tables with different geometry types (Point, Polygon, and Linestring).  
- Inserting spatial data into these tables using QGIS.  
- Verification of the inserted data using SQL queries.  

---

## **TD-3: Advanced Spatial Queries with PostGIS**  
- Introduction to spatial queries and operations in PostGIS.  
- Execution of queries to analyze spatial relationships and perform geometric operations.  
- Exploration of spatial joins and proximity-based queries.

**Conclusion**  
This TP provides a solid foundation in Spatial SQL, demonstrating how to manage spatial data effectively and use it for complex geospatial analyses. By integrating theory with practical exercises, students gain essential skills for working with spatial databases in GIS applications.
